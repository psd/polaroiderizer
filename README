Polaroiderizer is a little demo of using unobtrusive Javascript to make a simple slideshow.
It uses jQuery to animated images grabbed from flickr.

This version was forked:

    http://github.com/philhawksworth/polaroiderizer
    http://github.com/psd/polaroiderizer

and hacked for Byte Night 2009:

    http://bytenight.org.uk

Where it was used for a live display of flickr photos, twiter tweets, and photos from twitpic, yfrog, etc:

For 2010 we've put it up on TiddlySpace:

which uses the spaces:

KNOWN BUGS:
# noticed strange jumping layout as photos fade in in IE6
# "ready" detection for images from yfrog, etc seems to be broken 
# localtime handled in a buggy way for the night
# relative time needs refreshing when a slide is displayed
# UI handling for transition options broken -- always cycles

TBD:
# check bytenight hacks work in generic index.html form
# ordered insert using binary chop
# add "cycle" to transition option
# allow turn-on-an-offability for the feeds
# investigate using http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload
# make transitions more extensible and less hard-coded 
# make feeds more extensible and less hard-coded 
# some more interesting transitions
# UI for handling the moderated feed
# make moderated feed location configrable
# keyboard shortcuts to pause, play, reverse back to previous photo
# archive/run from an archive of tweets
