Polaroiderizer is a little demo of using unobtrusive Javascript to make a simple slideshow.
It uses jQuery to animated images grabbed from flickr.

Forked and hacked for http://bytenight.osmosoft.com to pull down tweets, and photos from twitpic, yfrog, etc.

KNOWN BUGS:
# had to put moderated code inline -- too many script includes?
# noticed strange jumping layout as photos fade in in IE6
# "ready" detection for images from yfrog, etc seems to be broken 

TBD:
# investigate using http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload
# check bytenight hacks work in generic index.html form
# correctly order tweets and photos by time, rather than insertion order
# make transitions more extensible and less hard-coded
# some more interesting transitions
# fine tuning of display to jump to fresh content as it comes in, and reveal older stuff to stop people getting bored
# UI for handling the moderated feed
# make moderated feed location configrable
