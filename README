Polaroiderizer is a little demo of using unobtrusive Javascript to make a simple slideshow.
It uses jQuery to animated images grabbed from flickr.

This version was forked:

    http://github.com/philhawksworth/polaroiderizer
    http://github.com/psd/polaroiderizer

and hacked for Byte Night 2009:

    http://bytenight.org.uk

Where it was used for a live display of flickr photos, twiter tweets, and photos from twitpic, yfrog, etc:

KNOWN BUGS:
# noticed strange jumping layout as photos fade in in IE6
# "ready" detection for images from yfrog, etc seems to be broken 
# had to put moderated code inline -- too many script includes?
# localtime handled in a buggy way for the night

TBD:
# correctly order tweets and photos by time, rather than insertion order
# investigate using http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload
# check bytenight hacks work in generic index.html form
# add "random" to transition "options"
# make transitions more extensible and less hard-coded 
# some more interesting transitions
# fine tuning of display to jump to fresh content as it comes in, and reveal older stuff to stop people getting bored
# UI for handling the moderated feed
# make moderated feed location configrable
# keyboard shortcuts to pause, play, reverse back to previous photo
